# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 2

## Introduction

The goal of this assignment is to implement a simple REST API for a Poll application using Spring Boot. This will serve as the foundation for a future software project.

## Setup

### Project Configuration

- Spring Boot version: 2.5.4
- Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, H2 Database

### Domain Models

The domain models include `User`, `Poll`, `VoteOption`, and `Vote`, with the following relationships:
- A `User` can create multiple `Polls`.
- A `Poll` has multiple `VoteOptions`.
- A `Vote` is associated with a single `VoteOption` and a `User`.

### Controllers

Implemented CRUD operations for all domain models:
- `UserController`: Handles operations for `User`.
- `PollController`: Handles operations for `Poll`.
- `VoteOptionController`: Handles operations for `VoteOption`.
- `VoteController`: Handles operations for `Vote`.

## Technical Issues and Solutions

- **Serialization Cycles**: Managed using `@JsonIgnore` and `@JsonManagedReference`.
- **Validation**: Added validation annotations to ensure data integrity.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented global exception handler to provide user-friendly error responses.

## Remaining Issues

- Further testing is needed to ensure robustness.
- Additional validation and business logic can be implemented for better data integrity.

## Conclusion

The project lays a solid foundation for a Poll application with a REST API. Future improvements include more comprehensive testing, additional validation, and enhanced error handling.
